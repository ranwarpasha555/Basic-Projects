#House Price Prediction with XGBoost(used for Decision making) :
    Machine Learning - Building a regression model to predict prices of Houses
    XGBoost is a popular algorithm for regression problems, and it's known for its high accuracy and speed. It's a type of gradient boosting algorithm that combines several weak models to create a robust and accurate predictive model.

1--> Basic Library :
    Pandas : Pandas is a powerful data analysis library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

    numpy: NumPy provides a large collection of mathematical functions that can be applied to NumPy arrays. These functions include linear algebra operations, Fourier transforms, and random number generation. NumPy also provides functions for working with strings, dates, and times.

    matpltlib: Matplotlib is a Python library that enables users to generate visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts and much more. It is a powerful tool for data analysis and exploration, and is widely used in scientific research, machine learning, and data visualization.

    seaborn : Seaborn is a Python data visualization library built on top of matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is designed to work with Pandas dataframes, making it easy to create visualizations with minimal code.

2--> Univariate analysis-Bar plots on object variables :
    Univariate analysis explores each variable's range of values, central tendency, and pattern of response. It also describes the distribution of the variable, or "the way the scores are distributed across the levels of that variable".

3--> Correcting the datatypes of some features :
    
4--> Dropping Irrelevant features.

5--> Deleting Outliers.

6-->feature engineering :
     -- Normalizing Numerical Features.
     -- Ordinal Encode ordered categorical features.
     -- One Hot Encode Nominal categorical features.

7-->Model building :
    -- Build a cross validation model to check the performance of the algorithm eg xgboost, random forest.
    -- Import the machine learning algorithm(XGBOOST).
    -- Building RMSE function for the predicted values.
    -- Fitting the dataset to the XGBoost model.


8-->Predicting the Values :
    -- Getting the score of the predicted value of the train set.
    -- Getting the score of the predicted value of test set.
    -- Printing the predicted test values.

9--> Testing Process :
    -- Using Train_Test_Split method .
    -- Splitting the Train and test Data.
    -- Testing Both the train and test data.
    
Overall, this project is an exciting opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem and gain valuable insights into the housing market. I hope you enjoy following along as I explore and analyze the data and build a predictive model using XGBoost
