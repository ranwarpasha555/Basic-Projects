#This Project Is Used For to_do_list Application......(file : to_do_list.py)
    A to-do list is a list of tasks that need to be completed or things,
    that want to be done. To-do lists can be written on paper or using task management software.
    They can include tasks for personal or professional life, such as replying to an email or creating a project brief.

#Requirements Of the Project........
    
    1--> Using Python :
        Python is a general-purpose programming language that is used for web development, software development, machine learning, and data science.
         It is an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before it can be run.
         This makes it a good choice for beginners because it is easy to learn and use.

    2--> using Thinker Library(graphical interface):
        Tkinter is a graphical user interface (GUI) library for Python scripts.
         It's the most commonly used method for creating GUIs in Python.
         Tkinter is open source and portable. It's included in all standard Python distributions and is Python's only built-in framework.
          Tkinter is known for its simplicity and graphical user interface.

    3--> Excel Sheet.(file :  task.csv).
    
    4-->Different Functions.
        ... ADD Functions :
                  This used to add the task in to the application.

        ... Delete Function :
                  this used to delete the task from the to do list by selecting the task.

        ... Save Function : 
                    This used to save the function, so that it can be esily save in the Excel sheet.

        ... Load functions :
                    This used to load the list of task after saving the list of task from the used ,else it cant be load after that,
                    so  we can seee the save list tasks.

# Testing the code :
    In this we tested the code , with for different functions as shown above.
    In this it contains four(4) functions ,which contains the different process.
